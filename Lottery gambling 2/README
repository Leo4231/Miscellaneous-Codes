Who doesn't like playing the lottery? You know the drill by now! 
I've written a programme that helps you pick numbers as many times as you like!
You need to input the following: Any digits you like and what position it is!
In Singapore, the 4D digits range from 0000 - 9999 inclusive.
To fix a digit, answer Yes/No, followed by the digit and the position (1,2,3 or 4).
